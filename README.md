👋 Hi, I'm Nico Liu

I work as a marketing analyst in the past 1 year for an amazon DSP advertising agency. As a person without much data background before starting career, I was enamored by visulization and data presentation tools and then decided to pursue a master degree in analytic at simon business school. I'm still on my way to learn programming languages, machine learning & database management. Eager to meet someone like-minded!

In spare time, I'm a heavy reader, and I love oil painting and piano ~ 

Fun fact: I love love love children's books 😄, especially with some interactive book design. Peter Pan is my current obession! 🧚‍♀️🏴‍☠️🌟🐊⏲
