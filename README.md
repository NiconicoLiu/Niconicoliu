👋 Hi, I'm Nico Liu

I work as a marketing analyst in the past 1 year for an amazon DSP advertising agency. As a person without much data background before starting career, I was enamored by visualization and data analysis tools and then decided to pursue a master degree in analytic at simon business school. I'm still on my way to learn programming languages, machine learning & database management. Eager to meet someone like-minded!

Data science skills:
- Regression and Forecasting; Clustering and Segmentation; Decision Tree; Random Forest
- A/B testing
- Conjoint analysis, focus groups, experiment construction
- Data cleaning 

Software Proficiency:
- Python; R; SQL;
- Tableau, powerBi
- Advanced Excel
- Simmons
- STATA, SPSS




Fun fact: I love love love children's books 😄, especially with some interactive book design. Peter Pan is my current obsession! 🧚‍♀️🏴‍☠️🌟🐊⏲
